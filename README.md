# Cadmus Migration V2

Tools for migrating (importing/exporting) Cadmus data. Export tools also include "preview", i.e. a human-friendly, highly customizable output for each Cadmus object, to be integrated in the editor itself.

üëâ This is the second generation of Cadmus migration components. For compatibility reasons, the previous generation can be still be reached at its [original repository](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-migration). Cadmus API from major version 11 and UI from major version 13 have been updated to this new version.

üëÄ [Cadmus Page](https://myrmex.github.io/overview/cadmus/)

Main projects:

- `Cadmus.Export`: general purpose components used to export Cadmus data.
- `Cadmus.Export.ML`: markup related components used to export Cadmus data into some markup language, typically XML.
- `Cadmus.Import`: core components for thesauri import.
- `Cadmus.Import.Excel`: Excel (XLSX or XLS) thesauri importers.
- `Cadmus.Import.Proteus`: Proteus-based components for importing Cadmus items and parts from sources handled with Proteus readers.

## History

- 2025-04-16: use IsAccepted in `TeiHelper` to distinguish between `lem` and `rdg` in `TeiAppLinearTextTreeRenderer` (and `TeiAppParallelTextTreeRenderer`).`
- 2025-04-11:
  - updated packages (including Proteus). Note that test `TeiAppParallelTextTreeRendererTest` is broken but this is due only to the fact that this code is a stub for future implementation.
  - added entry's `Tag` rendition (in `@type`) for `lem`/`rdg` in `TeiAppLinearTextTreeRenderer`.
- 2025-03-14: more tests.
- 2025-03-11: fixes to `AppParallelTextTreeFilter`.
- 2025-03-05: updated packages.

### 6.0.0

- 2025-02-26: ‚ö†Ô∏è refactored export models:
  - for text, introduced tree between source models and rendition; tree filters can be used to change the tree itself, or to add features to its metadata from specific layers.
  - the preview factory configuration has changed to include new components and exclude the obsolete blocks
  - the preview get blocks method has been replaced with a get spans method using a new model.
  - for TEI, a new set of components allow for simple TEI with linear trees with apparatus. Another set of components is planned to replace standoff-TEI with different strategies. Standoff will still be derived from trees, variously filtered, fragmented into ranges linked to zero or more layer fragments. The corresponding standoff entries, rendered by JSON renderers as before, will be referred to the text via a range of ranges: from the first range to the last one connected to each specific layer fragment. To this end we can use a `loc` child element like `<loc spanFrom="#a" spanTo="#c"/>`.
  - the CLI tool infrastructure has been modernized.
  - component tags have been uniformed to always have the prefix `it.vedph.`.

Anyway, in the end you just have to update your libraries and a single namespace reference. Benefits include:
  - more streamlined component instantiation.
  - more functionality in components factory, including DI.
  - dropped third party dependencies.
  - adopted standard MS technologies for DI.
